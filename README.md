#freeCodeCamp

freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization devoted to teaching people free web programming. This is a collection of projects made for freeCodeCamp.org's curriculum. The curriculum is divided into major web technologies and languages, each taking around three hundred hours to complete according to freeCodeCamp's website. freeCodeCamp has numerous lessons for each area of the course ending in five projects that must be completed in order to receive a certification for that area. I've mirrored the structure of freeCodeCamp.org when organizing the projects I've made. Each folder in this repository is named for the for the technology it's focused on.
